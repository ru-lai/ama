# ru-lai/ama

A repository to ask [Ru-Lai](https://github.com/ru-lai) anything. I forked this ama from holden after seeing @mdo use this format.

I have worked at a few startups and large companies in Taiwan and the states. If you have a question you're interested in asking me, write it out here, and I'll do my best to get back as quick as possible.

### Ask a question

Asking a question is as easy as
[creating a new issue](https://github.com/ru-lai/ama/issues/new) on this
project.

I'll try to answer it as soon as I can get to it. Once I answer I'll close the
issue so I know that I have given an answer.  If you have further responses / questions on the topic, feel free to respond in the closed issue or open another.
I'll read it and respond either way.

### Read some questions

Check out the [Closed Issues](https://github.com/ru-lai/ama/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed)
filter on this repository to browse questions I've answered in the past. I try
to use this as an email replacement that everyone can see, so feel free to dig
into some of the older threads.
